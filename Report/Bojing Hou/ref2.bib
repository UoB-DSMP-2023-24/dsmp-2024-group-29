abstract = {Tourism seasonality is generally seen as a problem for most of the main destinations in the world, particularly from the point of view of sustainability. Despite its importance, no reasonably homogeneous international measurement of seasonality is yet available on the global scale. Using the best World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) data, the paper uses the coefficient of variation, over the period 2008–2013 and for the main destinations, as a measure of tourism seasonality. In addition to the descriptive results, the paper includes a mixed effects panel data model, which allows us to investigate some reasonable main global determinants of seasonality. The results may be summarized as follows. Firstly, the world seasonality shows an inverted U pattern. Secondly, the highest (and increasing) seasonality is concentrated in the Mediterranean countries. Lastly, in terms of empirical determinants, geographical location, and the income of the major markets of origin are globally significant variables.}

    abstract = { This research investigated perceived risks associated with central bank digital currency (CBDC) payment innovations and their effect on travelers’ adoption behavior, considering personal and product characteristics. This quantitative study determined that perceived risks, including financial, performance, privacy, psychological, and time risks, have an adverse effect on attitudes toward CBDC payment, which, in turn, affects the intention to adopt. In addition, this study underlined the moderating roles of consumer innovativeness, previous experience, structural assurance, and media encouragement in the link between perceived risk and attitude. The results advanced the understanding of travelers’ intention to use CBDC to pay for tourism products and services. }

    abstract = { The Brazilian retail sector has been experiencing a dynamic involving, on the one hand, a strong approximation toward the financial institutions and, on the other hand, an intense concentration process, foreign capital participation, initial public offers, and business operations internationalization, boosting the retail financialization environment. This paper explores this dynamic by focusing on the organizational impacts resulting from the diffusion of a financial logic on Brazilian financial retail field construction, gathering together different actors struggling to define the field’s rules. The paper uses secondary sources as well as 57 interviews with employees from the country’s 19 largest retail stores about their work transformation. Interesting insights ranging from embarrassment stemming from the failure to fulfill goals, retail workers’ rights (being legally considered banking workers), to the use of slave labor by multinational fashion supply chains are garnered. All of these elements connected underpin the Brazilian Financial Retail field.O setor varejista brasileiro passa por uma dinâmica envolvendo por um lado, uma forte aproximação com as instituições financeiras e, por outro, por um intenso processo de concentração, atuação de capital estrangeiro, aberturas de capital, internacionalização dos negócios, profissionalização da gestão, fomentando a financeirização do varejo nacional. Esta pesquisa visa contribuir explorando os impactos organizacionais resultantes da difusão dessa lógica de inspiração financeira sobre o varejo brasileiro que logra unir diferentes atores e suas respectivas fontes de (diferentes e divergentes) capitais na definição dos contornos e regras de um novo campo de atuação para as empresas varejistas. Os resultados desta pesquisa envolvem dados de fontes secundárias, além de informações colhidas junto a 57 entrevistas realizadas com funcionários das 19 maiores varejistas atuantes no país sobre mudanças na organização de seu trabalho. Os resultados apresentados envolvem desde situações embaraçosas relacionadas ao não cumprimento das metas, passando pela equiparação de funcionários do varejo a bancários, até o uso de mão-de-obra escrava por grandes cadeias de moda varejistas. Juntos, estes elementos corroboram a construção do campo do varejo financeiro brasileiro. }

abstract = {This study analyzes the willingness to pay for health insurance and hence the potential market for new low-cost health insurance product in Namibia, using the double bounded contingent valuation (DBCV) method. The findings suggest that 87 percent of the uninsured respondents are willing to join the proposed health insurance scheme and on average are willing to insure 3.2 individuals (around 90 percent of the average family size). On average respondents are willing to pay NAD 48 per capita per month and respondents in the poorest income quintile are willing to pay up to 11.4 percent of their income. This implies that private voluntary health insurance schemes, in addition to the potential for protecting the poor against the negative financial shock of illness, may be able to serve as a reliable income flow for health care providers in this setting.}

abstract = {In this research, we propose two new clustering algorithms, the improved competitive learning network (ICLN) and the supervised improved competitive learning network (SICLN), for fraud detection and network intrusion detection. The ICLN is an unsupervised clustering algorithm, which applies new rules to the standard competitive learning neural network (SCLN). The network neurons in the ICLN are trained to represent the center of the data by a new reward-punishment update rule. This new update rule overcomes the instability of the SCLN. The SICLN is a supervised version of the ICLN. In the SICLN, the new supervised update rule uses the data labels to guide the training process to achieve a better clustering result. The SICLN can be applied to both labeled and unlabeled data and is highly tolerant to missing or delay labels. Furthermore, the SICLN is capable to reconstruct itself, thus is completely independent from the initial number of clusters. To assess the proposed algorithms, we have performed experimental comparisons on both research data and real-world data in fraud detection and network intrusion detection. The results demonstrate that both the ICLN and the SICLN achieve high performance, and the SICLN outperforms traditional unsupervised clustering algorithms.}

abstract="E-commerce is one of the fastest changing industries and consumers try to purchase most of the goods online. Following the internet revolution, retail and promotion, daily data generation led to a point where marketers could not further process, using the traditional statistical ways, the new demands of vast data volume. The use of big data analytics emerged, and the rise of AI came along with predictive analytics including machine learning and data mining solutions. Artificial Intelligence has both evolved and affected the way marketing is implemented. AI is proven to be a sophisticated way of analyzing and processing data as well as decision making. The privilege of its use is considered an asset to the business executives who understand its potential. Considering AI as a tool, it may provide massive data processing and prediction accuracy. Referring to marketing science, marketers have witnessed the benefits of AI by predicting consumers behavior. Since consumers behavior varies, brands struggle for customer satisfaction, they invest time and money to highlight their products or services potentials, better define their market share, and classify customers' needs. Marketers have been in pursuit of customer satisfaction using AI tools to read web metrics and optimize reach and conversions strategies. Machine learning, natural language processing, expert systems, voice, vision, planning, and robotics are the main AI branches that companies use to stay ahead of the competition. Business objectives aim to attract new customers, predict consumer behavior, along with the capability to personalize and predict demand using ``smart'' systems which allow them to increase sales, mitigate the decision-making risk and increase customer satisfaction, customer loyalty, and sales predictions. This chapter tries to map the stages of AI contribution to consumer behavior describing the essential marketing milestones.",

It integrates predictive systems in the process of delivery of personalized customer services for the recommendation of the products of a banking entity. The motivation behind this research is to improve aspects of customer support services, especially, achieve greater security, increased transparency and agility of processes as well as reduce entity management costs. The presented architecture includes fog nodes where data are processed by light intelligent agents allowing for the implementation of contextual recommendation systems together with the configuration of a Case Based Reasoning in the Cloud layer to improve the efficiency of the whole system over the time. The recommendation system is the cornerstone of architecture operating on banking products, such as mortgages, loans, retirement plans, etc., and it is developed by a hybrid method of recommendation: collaborative filtering combined with content-based filtering. The article analyzes the presented architecture while performing a verification and simulation of the data in the context of commercial banking. For this purpose, it shows the use of the proposed system of recommendations that represent the different communication channels as well as the possible devices. The proposed architecture offers the opportunity to improve the customer service in the bank’s physical channels and at the same time generate technological support to improve the resolution capacity of office managers, allowing employees to adopt a more versatile and flexible role. It also allows the evolution of the banking services model in offices while the processes that support it to follow a one-stop shop approach.}
